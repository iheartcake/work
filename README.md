Work
========

This is a record of my private repository contributions for the sake of my GitHub contribution panel, sans source code.

I used the wonderful [GitDummy](https://github.com/ebrian/gitdummy) by @ebrian with several private repos I've contributed to, and then created them as remotes off of eachother, then fetched, then merged- to make my commit history live in one repo.
