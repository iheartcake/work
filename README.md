Work
========

This is a record of my private repository contributions for the sake of my GitHub contribution panel, sans source code.

I used the wonderful [GitDummy](https://github.com/ebrian/gitdummy) by [@ebrian](https://github.com/ebrian) with several private repos I've contributed to in the last few years. I made this repo the master and then added the rest as remotes of this initial repo, then fetched, then merged them into here- to make my commit history from several repos live in one repo.
